    The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The
    series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge,
    Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and
    society, television, and the human condition.
